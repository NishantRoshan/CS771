Please ensure the following before testing the code:

1. Both files (predict.py and random_best) and folder(ims1) should be in the same directory
2. The folder ims1 is empty folder but must be present before running the code

We have kept a dummy file in 'ims1' folder as it is not possible to zip an empty folder.
